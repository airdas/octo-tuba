abstract = {A multi-machine database for the H-mode scrape-off layer power fall-off length, $\lambda$q in JET, DIII-D, ASDEX Upgrade, C-Mod, NSTX and MAST has been assembled under the auspices of the International Tokamak Physics Activity. Regression inside the database finds that the most important scaling parameter is the poloidal magnetic field (or equivalently the plasma current), with $\lambda$q decreasing linearly with increasing Bpol. For the conventional aspect ratio tokamaks, the regression finds , yielding $\lambda$q,ITER ≅ 1 mm for the baseline inductive H-mode burning plasma scenario at Ip = 15 MA. The experimental divertor target heat flux profile data, from which $\lambda$q is derived, also yield a divertor power spreading factor (S) which, together with $\lambda$q, allows an integral power decay length on the target to be estimated. There are no differences in the $\lambda$q scaling obtained from all-metal or carbon dominated machines and the inclusion of spherical tokamaks has no significant influence on the regression parameters. Comparison of the measured $\lambda$q with the values expected from a recently published heuristic drift based model shows satisfactory agreement for all tokamaks.},

abstract = {Recent experiments on the Type I ELMy H-mode regime performed at JET with improved diagnostics have expanded the range of parameters for the study of Type I ELM energy and particle losses. Deviations from the standard behaviour of such losses in some areas of the Type I ELMy H-mode operating space have revealed that the ELM losses are correlated with the parameters (density and temperature) of the pedestal plasma before the ELM crash, while other global ELM characteristics (such as ELM frequency) are a consequence of the ELM-driven energy and particle flux and of the in-between ELM energy and particle confinement. The relative Type I ELM plasma energy loss (to the pedestal energy) is found to correlate well with the collisionality of the pedestal plasma, showing a weak dependence on the method used to achieve those pedestal plasma parameters: plasma shaping, heating, pellet injection and impurity seeding. Effects of edge plasma collisionality and transport along the magnetic field,on the Type I ELM particle and energy fluxes onto the divertor target have also been observed. Two possible physical mechanisms that may give rise to the observed collisionality dependence of ELM energy losses are proposed and their consistency with the experimental measurements investigated: collisionality dependence of the edge bootstrap current with its associated influence on the ELM MHD origin and the limitation of the ELM energy loss by the impedance of the divertor target sheath to energy flow during the ELM event.},

abstract = {Edge-Localized-Modes (ELMs) are expected to present a significant transient flux of energy and particles to the ITER divertor. The threshold for ablation of the graphite target will be reached if the ELM transient exceeds Q/t1/2 to approximately 45 MJ m-2 s-1/2 where Q is the ELM deposition energy density and t the ELM deposition time. The ablation parameter in ITER can be determined by scaling four factors from present experiments: the ELM energy loss from the core plasma, the fraction of ELM energy deposited on the divertor target, the area of the ELM profile onto the target, and finally the time for the ELM deposition. Review of the ELM energy loss of Type I ELM data suggests an ITER ELM energy loss of 2-6{\%} of the stored energy or 25-80 MJ. The fraction of heating power crossing the separatrix due to ELMs is nearly constant (20-40{\%}) resulting in an inverse relationship between ELM amplitude and frequency. Measurements on DIII-D and ASDEX-Upgrade indicate that 50-80{\%} of the ELM energy is deposited on the target. There is currently no evidence for a large fraction of the ELM energy being dissipated through radiation. Profiles of the ELM heat flux are typically 1-2 times the width of steady heat flux between ELMs, with the ELM amplitude usually larger on the inboard target. The ELM deposition time varies from about 0.1 ms in JET to as high as 1.0 ms in ASDEX-Upgrade and DIII-D. The ELM deposition time for ITER will depend upon the level of conductive versus convective transport determined by the ratio of energy to particles released by the ELM. Preliminary analysis suggests that large Type I ELMs for low recycling H-mode may exceed the ablation parameter by a factor of 5. Promising regimes with smaller ELMS have been found at other edge operational regimes, including high density with gas puffing, use of RF heating and operation with Type III ELMs.},

@article{Federici2003,
abstract = {This paper presents the results of a preliminary assessment conducted to estimate the thermal response and erosion lifetime of the ITER divertor targets clad either with carbon-fibre composite or tungsten during type I ELMs. The one-dimensional thermal/erosion model, used for the analyses, is briefly described. It includes all the key surface heat transfer processes such as evaporation, melting, and radiation, and their interaction with the bulk thermal response, and it is based on an implicit finite-difference scheme, which allows for temperature-dependent material properties. The cases analysed clarify the influence of several ELM parameters on the heat transfer and erosion processes at the target (i.e. characteristic plasma ELM energy loss from the pedestal, fraction of the energy reaching the divertor, broadening of the strike-points during ELMs, duration and waveform of the ELM heat load) and design/material parameters (i.e. inclination of the target, type and thickness of the armour material, and for tungsten only, fraction of the melt layer loss). Comparison is made between cases where all ELMs are characterized by the same fixed averaged parameters, and cases where instead the characteristic parameters of each ELM are evaluated in a random fashion by using a standard Monte Carlo technique, based on distributions of some of the variables of interest derived from experiments in today's machines. Although uncertainties rule out providing firm quantitative predictions, the results of this study are useful to illustrate trends. Based on the results, the implications on the design and operation are discussed and priorities are determined for the R{\&}D needed to reduce the remaining uncertainties.},

@article{Loarte2003,
abstract = {Analysis of Type I ELMs from ongoing experiments shows that ELM energy losses are correlated with the density and temperature of the pedestal plasma before the ELM crash. The Type I ELM plasma energy loss normalized to the pedestal energy is found to correlate across experiments with the collisionality of the pedestal plasma (v(ped)(*)),decreasing with increasing v(ped)(*). Other parameters affect the ELM size, such as the edge magnetic shear, etc, which influence the plasma volume affected by the ELMs. ELM particle losses are influenced by this ELM affected volume and are weakly dependent on other pedestal plasma parameters. In JET and DIII-D, under some conditions, ELMs can be observed ('minimum' Type I ELMs with energy losses acceptable for ITER), that do not affect the plasma temperature. The duration of the divertor ELM power pulse is correlated with the typical ion transport time from the pedestal to the divertor target (tau(parallel to)(Front) = 2piRq(95)/c(s,ped)) and not with the duration of the ELM-associated MHD activity. Similarly, the timescale of ELM particle fluxes is also determined by tau(parallel to)(Front). The extrapolation of the present experimental results to ITER is summarized.},

abstract = {Progress in the definition of the requirements for edge localized mode (ELM) control and the application of ELM control methods both for high fusion performance DT operation and non-active low-current operation in ITER is described. Evaluation of the power fluxes for low plasma current H-modes in ITER shows that uncontrolled ELMs will not lead to damage to the tungsten (W) divertor target, unlike for high-current H-modes in which divertor damage by uncontrolled ELMs is expected. Despite the lack of divertor damage at lower currents, ELM control is found to be required in ITER under these conditions to prevent an excessive contamination of the plasma by W, which could eventually lead to an increased disruptivity. Modelling with the non-linear MHD code JOREK of the physics processes determining the flow of energy from the confined plasma onto the plasma-facing components during ELMs at the ITER scale shows that the relative contribution of conductive and convective losses is intrinsically linked to the magnitude of the ELM energy loss. Modelling of the triggering of ELMs by pellet injection for DIII-D and ITER has identified the minimum pellet size required to trigger ELMs and, from this, the required fuel throughput for the application of this technique to ITER is evaluated and shown to be compatible with the installed fuelling and tritium re-processing capabilities in ITER. The evaluation of the capabilities of the ELM control coil system in ITER for ELM suppression is carried out (in the vacuum approximation) and found to have a factor of ∼2 margin in terms of coil current to achieve its design criterion, although such a margin could be substantially reduced when plasma shielding effects are taken into account. The consequences for the spatial distribution of the power fluxes at the divertor of ELM control by three-dimensional (3D) fields are evaluated and found to lead to substantial toroidal asymmetries in zones of the divertor target away from the separatrix. Therefore, specifications for the rotation of the 3D perturbation applied for ELM control in order to avoid excessive localized erosion of the ITER divertor target are derived. It is shown that a rotation frequency in excess of 1 Hz for the whole toroidally asymmetric divertor power flux pattern is required (corresponding to n Hz frequency in the variation of currents in the coils, where n is the toroidal symmetry of the perturbation applied) in order to avoid unacceptable thermal cycling of the divertor target for the highest power fluxes and worst toroidal power flux asymmetries expected. The possible use of the in-vessel vertical stability coils for ELM control as a back-up to the main ELM control systems in ITER is described and the feasibility of its application to control ELMs in low plasma current H-modes, foreseen for initial ITER operation, is evaluated and found to be viable for plasma currents up to 5–10 MA depending on modelling assumptions.},

Since one main$\backslash$n difference in transport characteristics between L- and H-mode is turbulence, we compare turbulent$\backslash$n particle characteristics. We find that in L-mode (MAST) the fluctuations and E × B shear increase at$\backslash$n the plasma edge, whereas in H-mode (DIII-D) the fluctuations decrease at the plasma edge. Deeper$\backslash$n inside the core, the E × B shear remains similar in L-mode (MAST), whereas a large decrease that$\backslash$n quickly saturates with RMP strength is observed in H-mode (DIII-D).

abstract = {Edge localized modes (ELMs) are the focus of increasing attention by the edge physics community because of the potential impact that the large divertor heat pulses due to ELMs would have on the divertor design of future high power tokamaks such as ITER. This paper reviews what is known about ELMs, with an emphasis on their effect on the scrape-off layer and divertor plasmas. ELM effects have been measured in the ASDEX-U, C-Mod, COMPASS-D, DIII-D, JET, JFT-2M, JT-60U and TCV tokamaks,and are reported here. At least three types of ELMs have been identified and their salient features determined. Type 1 giant ELMs can cause the sudden loss of up to 10-15{\%} of the plasma stored energy, but their amplitude (Delta W/W) does not increase with heating power. Type 3 ELMs are observed near the II-mode power threshold and produce small energy dumps (1-3{\%} of the stored energy). All ELMs increase the scrape-off layer plasma and produce particle fluxes on the divertor targets which are as much as ten times larger than the quiescent phase between ELMs. The divertor heat pulse is largest on the inner target, unlike that of L-mode or quiescent PI-mode; some tokamaks report radial structure in the heat flux profile which is suggestive of islands or helical structures. The power scaling of type 1 ELM amplitude and frequency has been measured in several tokamaks and has recently been applied to predictions of the ELM size in ITER. Concern over the expected ELM amplitude has led to a number of experiments aimed at demonstrating active control of ELMs. Impurity gas injection with feedback control on the radiation loss in ASDEX-U suggests that a promising mode of operation (the CDH-mode) with very small type 3 ELMs can be maintained with heating power well above the II-mode threshold, where giant type 1 ELMs are normally observed. While ELMs have many potential negative effects, the beneficial effect of ELMs in providing density control and limiting the core plasma impurity content in high confinement II-mode discharges should not be overlooked.},

Internal transport barriers and other forms of reduced core transport are now routinely obtained in all the leading tokamak devices worldwide. (3) The importance of controlling the H-mode edge pedestal is now generally recognized. Substantial progress has been made in extending high confinement H-mode operation to the Greenwald density, the demonstration of Type I ELM mitigation and control techniques and systematic explanation of Type I ELM stability. Theory-based predictive capability has also shown progress by integrating the plasma and neutral transport with MHD stability. (4) Transport projections to ITER are now made using three complementary approaches: empirical or global scaling, theory-based transport modelling and dimensionless parameter scaling (previously, empirical scaling was the dominant approach). For the ITER base case or the reference scenario of conventional ELMy H-mode operation, all three techniques predict that ITER will have sufficient confinement to meet its design target of {\textless}I{\textgreater}Q{\textless}/I{\textgreater} = 10 operation, within similar uncertainties.{\textless}/P{\textgreater}},

abstract = {In this paper the manipulation of power deposition on divertor targets at DIII-D by the application of resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) for suppression of large type-I edge localized modes (ELMs) is analysed. We discuss the modification of the ELM characteristics by the RMP applied. It is shown that the width of the deposition pattern in ELMy H-mode depends linearly on the ELM deposited energy, whereas in the RMP phase of the discharge those patterns are controlled by the externally induced magnetic perturbation. It was also found that the manipulation of heat transport due to the application of small, edge RMP depends on the plasma pedestal electron collisionality nu(e)*. We compare in this analysis RMP and no RMP phases with and without complete ELM suppression. At high nu(e)* {\textgreater} 0.5, the heat flux during the ELM suppressed phase is of the same order as the inter-ELM and the no-RMP phase. However, below this collisionality value, a slight increase in the total power flux to the divertor is observed during the RMP phase. This is most likely caused by a more negative potential at the divertor surface due to hot electrons reaching the divertor surface from the pedestal area along perturbed, open field lines.},

abstract = {All current estimations of the energy released by type I ELMs indicate that, in order to ensure an adequate lifetime of the divertor targets on ITER, a mechanism is required to decrease the amount of energy released by an ELM, or to eliminate ELMs altogether. One such amelioration mechanism relies on perturbing the magnetic field in the edge plasma region, either leading to more frequent, smaller ELMs (ELM mitigation) or ELM suppression. This technique of Resonant Magnetic Perturbations (RMPs) has been employed to suppress type I ELMs at high collisionality/density on DIII-D, ASDEX Upgrade, KSTAR and JET and at low collisionality on DIII-D. At ITER-like collisionality the RMPs enhance the transport of particles or energy and keep the edge pressure gradient below the 2D linear ideal MHD critical value that would trigger an ELM, whereas at high collisionality/density the type I ELMs are replaced by small type II ELMs. Although ELM suppression only occurs within limitied operational ranges, ELM mitigation is much more easily achieved. The exact parameters that determine the onset of ELM suppression are unknown but in all cases the magnetic perturbations produce 3D distortions to the plasma and enhanced particle transport. The incorporation of these 3D effects in codes will be essential in order to make quantitative predictions for future devices.},

abstract = {Operating ITER in the reference inductive scenario at the design values of Ip = 15MA andQDT = 10 requires the achievement of good H-mode confinement that relies on the presence of an edge transport barrier whose pedestal pressure height is key to plasma performance. Strong gradients occur at the edge in such conditions that can drive magnetohydrodynamic instabilities resulting in edge localized modes (ELMs), which produce a rapid energy loss from the pedestal region to the plasma facing components (PFC). Without appropriate control, the heat loads on PFCs during ELMs in ITER are expected to become significant for operation in H-mode at Ip = 6–9MA; operation at higher plasma currents would result in a very reduced life time of the PFCs. Currently, several options are being considered for the achievement of the required level of ELM control in ITER; this includes operation in plasma regimes which naturally have no or very small ELMs, decreasing the ELM energy loss by increasing their frequency by a factor of up to 30 and avoidance of ELMs by actively controlling the edge with magnetic perturbations. Small/no ELM regimes obtained by influencing the edge stability (by plasma shaping, rotational shear control, etc) have shown in present experiments a significant reduction of the ELM heat fluxes compared to type-I ELMs. However, so far they have only been observed under a limited range of pedestal conditions depending on each specific device and their extrapolation to ITER remains uncertain. ELM control by increasing their frequency relies on the controlled triggering of the edge instability leading to the ELM. This has been presently demonstrated with the injection of pellets and with plasma verticalmovements; pellets having provided the results more promising for application in ITER conditions. ELM avoidance/suppression takes advantage of the fact that relatively small changes in the pedestal plasma and magnetic field parameters seem to have a large stabilizing effect on large ELMs. Application of edge magnetic field perturbation with non-axisymmetric fields is found to affect transport at the plasma edge and thus prevent the uncontrolled rise of the plasma pressure gradients and the occurrence of type-I ELMs. This paper compiles a brief overview of various ELM control approaches, summarizes their present achievements and briefly discusses the open issues regarding their application in ITER.},

abstract = {The evolution of the parameters of the plasma in the termination phase of high confinement H-modes at JET with carbon fibre composite plasma facing components (JET-C) has been analysed with a view to predict the dynamics of the plasma energy decrease for sudden terminations of the ITER Q DT = 10 scenario caused by malfunction of additional heating systems. JET-C experiments show that the rate of decay of the plasma energy in the high performance H-mode termination phase is predominantly determined by the duration of the type III ELMy H-mode phase after the end of the type I ELMy H-mode regime. Longer type III ELMy H-mode phase durations lead to slower plasma energy decay rates. The duration of the type III ELMy H-mode phase is itself determined by the margin of the edge power flow (dominated by the rate of collapse of the plasma energy) over the H-mode threshold power in the termination phase, with larger margins leading to longer type III ELMy H-mode phase durations. For most of the JET-C discharges analysed the timescale for the plasma energy decrease in the termination of high energy confinement H-modes is comparable to the energy confinement time of the plasma in the high confinement phase rather than half of this value, which is to be expected for instantaneous H–L transitions. Modelling of the termination phase of ITER Q DT = 10 H-modes (with transport assumptions in this phase validated against JET-C experiments) shows that similar to JET-C results the timescale for the decrease of the plasma energy is comparable and can even be longer than the energy confinement time of the burning phase, provided that ELM control can be maintained. This is due to the long sustainment of the type III ELMy H-mode by the substantial edge power flow compared to the H-mode threshold power during this phase. The large edge power flow in the termination phase of ITER high Q DT plasmas is provided by the decrease of the plasma energy and the slow collapse of the alpha heating. Operational strategies in ITER to control the energy decay rate as well as the consequences of the lack of ELM control in the high Q DT termination phase are presented.},

This study is performed in$\backslash$ncomparison with results from TEXTOR-Dynamic Ergodic Divertor circular$\backslash$nlimiter plasmas. For both experiments the magnetic field structure is$\backslash$nanalyzed in the vacuum paradigm--superimposing the external RMP field$\backslash$non the unperturbed equilibrium. For TEXTOR L-mode plasmas this$\backslash$ndescription holds for normalized poloidal flux PsN {\textgreater} 0.7 without$\backslash$ntearing modes driven by the RMP field. For DIII-D H-mode plasmas the$\backslash$nvalidity of this approach still needs to be established. In this paper$\backslash$na method is discussed to diagnose the degree of edge stochastization$\backslash$nbased on a comparison between modeled magnetic footprints on the$\backslash$ndivertor targets and experimental data. Clear evidence is presented$\backslash$nfor the existence of a generic separatrix perturbation causing$\backslash$nstriation of target particle fluxes. However, heat fluxes into these$\backslash$nstriations are small. This observation can be explained by accounting$\backslash$nfor the different heat and particle source locations and the 3D$\backslash$ntrajectories of the open, perturbed field lines toward the divertor$\backslash$ntarget. Analysis of the transport characteristics filling the$\backslash$nperturbed separatrix lobes based on initial EMC3/EIRENE modeling$\backslash$nsuggests the existence of open field lines connecting the stochastic$\backslash$nedge to the target pattern.

abstract = {Recent experiments on DIII-D have increased confidence in the ability to suppress edge-localized modes (ELMs) using edge-resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) in ITER, including an improved physics basis for the edge response to RMPs as well as expansion of RMP ELM suppression to more ITER-like conditions. Complete ELM suppression has been achieved utilizing n = 3 RMPs in the ITER baseline scenario. In addition, RMP ELM suppression has been expanded to include plasmas with helium concentrations near 25{\%} and the use of n = 2 RMPs. Analysis of the kinetic profile response suggests that ELM suppression is correlated with the co-alignment of the $\omega$ ⊥e = 0 location, an n = 3 rational surface, and the top of the pedestal. Modelling predicts that such a co-alignment could potentially lead to island (or island chain) formation just inside the top of the pedestal, inhibiting the growth of the pedestal and thereby maintaining the ELM-free state. Detailed analysis of data obtained during toroidal phase variations of the applied n = 3 RMPs have provided further evidence of an island-like structure at the top of the pedestal. In addition, nearly matched discharges with co-neutral-beam-injection (co-NBI) and counter-NBI have demonstrated the importance of the presence of the $\omega$ ⊥e = 0 location for ELM suppression. In the counter-NBI cases, the toroidal rotation profile is such that there is no $\omega$ ⊥e = 0 location and ELMs are not suppressed in conditions in which ELM suppression is generally observed with co-NBI.},

abstract = {An increase in ELM frequency has been demonstrated in MAST by applying resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) with toroidal mode number, n RMP = 2, 3, 4, 6. It has been observed that the mitigated ELM frequency increases with the amplitude of the applied field provided it is above a critical threshold. This threshold value depends on the mode number of the RMP, with higher n RMP having a larger critical value. For the same ELM frequency, the reduction in the peak heat load on the divertor plates is approximately the same for all RMP configurations. The RMPs give rise to perturbations to the plasma shape, with lobe structures occurring due to the tangled magnetic fields near the X-point, and corrugations of the plasma boundary at the midplane. The X-point lobe length increases linearly with the applied field when above a threshold, with RMPs of higher toroidal mode number giving rise to longer lobes for the same applied resonant field. Similarly, the midplane displacements increase with the applied field strength, though the corrugation amplitude is less dependent upon the RMP configuration. For all n RMP , the RMPs result in enhanced particle transport and a reduction in the pedestal pressure gradient caused by an increased pedestal width, which is found to be consistent with a decrease in the critical pressure at which infinite- n ballooning modes are driven unstable in non-axisymmetric plasmas. The plasma rotation braking is strongest for lowest n RMP whilst the degradation of access to H-mode resultant from the application of RMPs are non-monotonic in n RMP , with the optimal case for both occurring for n RMP = 4. Whilst there are advantages and disadvantages for all RMP configurations, the configurations found to be optimised in terms of pedestal degradation, access to H-mode, plasma rotation and distortion to the plasma configuration in MAST are n RMP = 3 or 4, consistent with the configurations anticipated for use in ITER.},

abstract = {Large Type-I edge localized modes (ELMs) are completely eliminated with small n = 3 resonant magnetic perturbations (RMP) in low average triangularity, (delta) over bar = 0.26, plasmas and in ITER similar shaped (ISS) plasmas, delta = 0.53, with ITER relevant collisionalities v(e)* {\textless}= 0.2. Significant differences in the RMP requirements and in the properties of the ELM suppressed plasmas are found when comparing the two triangularities. In ISS plasmas, the current required to suppress ELMs is approximately 25{\%} higher than in low average triangularity plasmas. It is also found that the width of the resonant q(95) window required for ELM suppression is smaller in ISS plasmas than in low average triangularity plasmas. An analysis of the positions and widths of resonant magnetic islands across the pedestal region, in the absence of resonant field screening or a self-consistent plasma response, indicates that differences in the shape of the q profile may explain the need for higher RMP coil currents during ELM suppression in ISS plasmas. Changes in the pedestal profiles are compared for each plasma shape as well as with changes in the injected neutral beam power and the RMP amplitude. Implications of these results are discussed in terms of requirements for optimal ELM control coil designs and for establishing the physics basis needed in order to scale this approach to future burning plasma devices such as ITER.},

abstract = {A comprehensive set of L–H transition experiments has been performed on DIII-D to determine the requirements for access to H-mode plasmas in ITER's first (non-nuclear) operational phase with H and He plasmas and the second (activated) operational phase with D plasmas. The H-mode power threshold, PTH, was evaluated for different operational configurations and auxiliary heating methods for the different main ion species. Helium plasmas have significantly higher PTH than deuterium plasmas at low densities for all heating schemes, but similar PTH as deuterium plasmas at high densities except for H-neutral beam injection-heated discharges, which are still higher. Changes in PTH are observed when helium concentration levels in deuterium plasmas exceed 40{\%}. There is a strong dependence of PTH on the magnetic geometry in the vicinity of the divertor. The trend of decreasing PTH with decreasing X-point height is observed for all of the main ion species irrespective of the heating method, which appears to indicate that there is a common physics process behind this effect for all of the ion species. Helium and deuterium plasmas exhibit a significant increase in PTH for strong resonant magnetic perturbations. The application of a local magnetic ripple of 3{\%} from test blanket module mock-up coils did not change PTH in deuterium plasmas.},

abstract = {The mitigation or suppresion of large edge localized modes (ELMs) is a critical issue for successful operation of ITER. In recent years, a concerted worldwide effort has emerged to develop efficient and reliable ELM mitigation and suppression techniques that can be scaled to the full range of ITER regimes and more generally to burning plasmas in a generic fusion reactor design. These techniques include the use of small-ELM or ELM-free regimes, the repetitive triggering of ELMs by external means, and the suppression of ELMS with non-axisymmetric fields. The extrapolation of all of these techniques to ITER is highly uncertain due to outstanding physics issues. However, two techniques have emerged as the preferred methods for use in ITER: ELM pacing using pellet injection and the use of edge resonant magnetic perturbations for ELM suppression. This paper discusses the issues related to ELM control in ITER, provides a general introduction to various ELM control techniques, and a more detailed discussion of the physics and engineering requirements of the two preferred techniques for ELM control in ITER. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},
